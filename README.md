# CookTail: Automated Cocktail-Making Robot
A two-person term project developed for the IoT and Robotics course, **CookTail** is an automated cocktail-making robot that mixes and serves drinks based on user input from a website. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware components (motors, sensors, LCD) with web-based control using **Arduino**, **C++**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

##  Features
- **Web-based ordering**: Users place drink orders through a website interface.
- **Automated mixing**: The robot retrieves ingredient ratios from a specified URL and activates motors to dispense each component.
- **Sensor-based safety**: A glass-detection sensor ensures the process only starts when a glass is present, preventing spills.
- **Real-time feedback**: An LCD screen displays operation status like “Preparing…” and “Cheers :)”.
- **Precision control**: Three motors are independently controlled using URL-based timing and volume instructions.
